Got FUSE?
  gotta have FUSE to make this work, it will be called soemthing like:
    libfuse, libfuse-dev or libfuse-devel
  Centos
    yum install fuse dkms-fuse fuse-devel
    # add your user to the fuse group - logout/login
	Gentoo
		emerge -va sys-fs/fuse
  OSX + MacPorts
    port install libfuse

Make some binaries:
  make  # hopefully that just works and you don't have any errors

Getting started:
  wget http://drze.net/junk/testfs
  mkdir .chunks
  mkdir mnt
  ./zunkfs --chunk-db=rw,dir:$PWD/.chunks \
           --chunk-db=ro,cmd:$PWD/fetch.sh ./testfs ./mnt
  cd mnt
  ls -la
